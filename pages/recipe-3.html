    <h1>Beef Stew for Dogs</h1>
    <p>This dog food recipe is very similar to a humans in that the beef is seared, then added to vegetables and boiled in a pot.
        The biggest difference in this homemade dog food recipe to ours is that there is no stock. 
        When cooking a stew for a dog, avoid any stock cubes or stock as it is of no benefit to the dog. 
        The stock may have ingredients such as garlic or onions that are not advisable to be consumed by dogs.
        This recipe could be cooked in an instant pot or slow cooker too.</p>
