    <h1>Simple Stovetop Homemade Dog Food</h1>

    <p>My dog, Charlie is 4 years old and <strong>I recently decided to start making his food from scratch</strong> instead of feeding him store-bought dog food.
    If everyone else in our house is eating Clean & Delicious, why shouldn't Charlie?
    There are so many different meal options you can create for your dog when making homemade dog food. 
    I'm going to start with a pretty straightforward, well-balanced recipe. 
    This is a great starter recipe, made up of ground turkey, veggies, and brown rice. 
    <strong>If you're not ready to jump into homemade dog food, you can always start with <a href="https://cleananddelicious.com/easy-healthy-diy-dog-treats-recipe/">some DIY dog treats</a> (our dog loves homemade treats!).</strong></p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>

    <ul>
        <li>1 tablespoon coconut oil</li>
        <li>1 pound ground turkey</li>
        <li>1 large zucchini shredded</li>
        <li>1 cup baby spinach finely chopped</li>
        <li>1 cup shredded carrots</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon turmeric</li>
        <li>1 egg</li>
        <li>3 cups cooked rice (I like using frozen brown rice)</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Instructions</h2>

    <ol>
        <li>Heat a large skillet or pot over a medium-high heat. 
            Add in the coconut oil and turkey and saut√© until it is browned and cooked through, about 10 minutes.</li>
        <li>Reduce the heat to medium and stir in the zucchini, spinach, carrots and turmeric. 
            Cook, stirring occasionally, for 5-7 minutes, until the vegetables are tender.</li>
        <li>Turn off the heat and and crack in the egg. 
            Let the egg cook in the hot food, mix it around to ensure it mixed through and cooked through.</li>
        <li>Stir in the rice until everything is well combined. Cool and serve!</li>
    </ol>
