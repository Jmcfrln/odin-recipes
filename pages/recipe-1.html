        Years ago my first Shih Tzu Lucky suffered from horrible allergies to chicken. 
        This went on for a long time, little did I know that was his issue. 
        He had a hard time keeping food down, wouldn't eat it, had skin issues, and I never knew why.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>3 pounds ground beef</li>
        <li>2 cups brown or white rice</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon sea salt</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon butter</li>
        <li>2 cups beef stock + ½ cup water</li>
        <li>1 ½ cups fresh broccoli, shred or cut finely or a 12 oz frozen bag</li>
        <li>2 cups fresh carrots, shred or cut into small coins 2 large carrots</li>
        <li>2 cups sweet potato, small cubes or shred 1 large sweet potato</li>
        <li>2 cups fresh spinach</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <h3>Make Rice</h3>
    <ol>
        <li><u>Rinse the rice</u> in a fine mesh strainer for about 30 seconds under cold water. It removes starches that makes rice sticky.</li>
        <li>Use a ratio of <u>1 cup rice to 2 cups water</u>, which you can scale up or down. (check your rice package instructions.) 
            <strong> Feel free to swap in beef, chicken, or vegetable broth for better flavor. 
            You can also use a good bullion to water for extra flavor.</strong></li>
        <li><u>Bring the broth stock/water to a boil</u>, add rice and salt (skip salt if using bullion). 
            And if you want to add a tab of butter, too, go for it — your rice will taste 10x better. 
            <u>Cover the pot and simmer for 18 minutes on low and don't remove the lid!</u> Brown rice takes 30 minutes.</li>
        <li>Check the rice, and if done turn off the heat, 
            replace the lid, and let it rest for several minutes in the steamy saucepan. 
            Use a fork to fluff it up!</li>
         <li>Chop, shred, or process in a food processor all the veggies. 
            My dog is a small dog and prefers the veggies finely shredded in a food processor.</li>
    </ol>
    <h3>Make Ground Beef and Veggies</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Brown and crumble 3 lbs of ground beef in a large skillet. Place in a large bowl.</li>
        <li>In a large cast iron pan or skillet, briefly saute carrots, broccoli, and sweet potato until just soft for a few minutes on medium.</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Mix Dog Food</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Into the large bowl with ground beef, add warm rice, warm sauted veggies, and fresh spinach.
             Mix well with a large spatula.</li>
        <li>Portion 4-5 cups of Homemade Dog Food per zip lock back, and store in an airtight container or larger zip top bag in the freezer. 
            Pull our one small bag per week, and reheat a serving for your dog in the microwave for 30 seconds. 
            I sometimes sprinkle some dry dog food into the homemade food to stretch out my homemade dog food batch.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Notes</h2>
    <p><em>Please consult with a veterinarian and use your good judgment of what is best for your dog's diet! 
        My dog happens to be <strong>allergic to chicken</strong> (her eyes constantly watered, were itchy, 
        and were stained plus she threw up her store-bought food!), 
        so that is why I use beef stock and ground beef-and oh does she love it!</em></p>
